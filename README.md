Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging yet essential task for financial analysts and investors. This project uses LSTM networks, well-suited for sequential data, to predict Chevron Corporation's stock prices. The model captures temporal dependencies and trends in stock market data, providing a reliable forecasting framework.

Key Features
Advanced Model:
LSTM neural network for sequential data analysis.
Performance Metrics:
MSE: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
MAE: Provides the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
R²: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Visualization:
Stock price trends and prediction accuracy visualized with time-series plots.

Project Workflow
Data Collection:
Fetch Chevron stock data using APIs or download from a reliable source.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and normalize the data for LSTM training.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Development:
Build and train the LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Optimize model parameters, including the number of layers, units, and epochs.
Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using MSE, MAE, and R².
Compare predictions against actual stock prices.
Visualization:
Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices to evaluate forecasting accuracy.
Results and Insights
Model Performance:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 12.591
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.821
R² Score: 0.745
Key Findings:
The model achieved a strong R² score, indicating it explains ~74.5% of the variance in Chevron's stock prices.
LSTM effectively captured temporal dependencies but can be improved with further tuning or feature engineering.
Visualization:
Time-series plots show the alignment of predicted prices with actual prices, validating the model's forecasting ability.
